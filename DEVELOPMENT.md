# Development Guide

This document contains information on how to build and release the plugin. If
you are looking to use the plugin please head over to [README.md](README.md).

## Building the plugin

1. Install dependencies

```BASH
yarn install
```

2. Build plugin in development mode or run in watch mode

```BASH
yarn dev
```

or

```BASH
yarn watch
```

3. Build plugin in production mode

```BASH
yarn build
```

## Maintenance

Code formatting

```BASH
yarn prettier --write src
```

Update dependencies

```BASH
yarn upgrade --latest
```

## Release

- update dependencies
- create pull request:
  - adapt version in package.json to `X.Y.Z`
  - add section in CHANGELOG.md: `## X.Y.Z`
- merge pull request into main branch
- tag commit in the main branch with `vX.Y.Z`
- save release draft on github

## E2E Tests

There are serval ways to run the e2e tests.
Make sure to have a up to date `dist/` folder using `yarn build`.

### Local development use case

```BASH
cd tests/
docker-compose up -d checkmk grafana
yarn run cypress open
```

This will show you a nice interactive GUI to run and debug your E2E tests.
See the official [docs](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/overview/why-cypress) for more information.

### No Interactivity use case (e.g. CI)

```BASH
cd tests/
docker-compose up --exit-code-from=cypress
```

This will run all tests without any further interaction necessary.

### No docker use case

If you don't want to or can't use docker at all, make sure you have a Grafana and a CheckMK instance running somewhere.
The Plugin you want to test needs to be installed in you Grafana instance.

You also need to set serval environment variables.

| Variable                    | Description                                  |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| CYPRESS_baseUrl             | The URL to your Grafana instance             |
| CYPRESS_grafanaUsername     | The username used to log into Grafana        |
| CYPRESS_grafanaPassword     | the password used to log into Grafana        |
| CYPRESS_grafanaToCheckmkUrl | The url from which grafana can reach CheckMK |
| CYPRESS_cypressToCheckmkUrl | The url from which cypress can reach CheckMK |
| CYPRESS_cmkUsername         | The username of a CheckMK admin              |
| CYPRESS_cmkPassword         | The password of that CheckMK admin           |

If everything is set up, just start cypress the usual way.

```BASH
yarn run cypress open

# or if you just want to see the results
yarn run cypress run
```

Please note that the test have side effects on your Grafana and CheckMK instance,
such as creating a new automation user.
